   <td>Baseline</td>

            Bit 0: Baseline for font at y=0;

<tr>
   <td>ClearTypeOptimized</td>
<td>
            Bit 13: Font optimized for ClearType™. <para />
            Note, fonts that rely on embedded bitmaps (EBDT) for rendering should not be considered optimized for ClearType, and therefore should keep this bit cleared.
            </td>

<tr>
   <td>Converted</td>

            Bit 12: Font converted (produce compatible metrics)

            Bit 4: Instructions may alter advance width (the advance widths might not scale linearly);

            Bit 3: Force ppem to integer values for all internal scaler math; may use fractional ppem sizes if this bit is clear;

<tr>
   <td>LastResort</td>
<td>
            Bit 14: Last Resort font. <para />
            If set, indicates that the glyphs encoded in the cmap subtables are simply generic symbolic representations of code point ranges and don't truly represent support for those code points. 
            If unset, indicates that the glyphs encoded in the cmap subtables represent proper support for those code points.
            </td>

<tr>
   <td>LeftSidebearing</td>
<td>
            Bit 1: Left sidebearing point at x=0 (relevant only for TrueType rasterizers) — see the note below regarding variable fonts;
            </td>
</tr>
<tr>
   <td>Lossless</td>
<td>
            Bit 11: Font data is "lossless" as a results of having been subjected to optimizing transformation and/or compression 
            (such as e.g. compression mechanisms defined by ISO/IEC 14496-18, MicroType Express, WOFF 2.0 or similar) where the original font functionality and features are retained but the 
            binary compatibility between input and output font files is not guaranteed. As a result of the applied transform, the 'DSIG' table may also be invalidated.

            Bit 5: This bit is not used in OpenType, and should not be set in order to ensure compatible behavior on all platforms. <para />
            If set, it may result in different behavior for vertical layout in some platforms. (See Apple's specification for details regarding behavior in Apple platforms.)
