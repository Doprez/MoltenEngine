            VDMX group. This table must appear in sorted order (sorted by yPelHeight), but need not be continous. It should have an entry for every pel height where the yMax and yMin do not scale linearly, where linearly scaled heights are defined as: <para />
            Hinted yMax and yMin are identical to scaled/rounded yMax and yMin
