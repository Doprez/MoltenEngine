A hint to a font system on what direction gylphs should flow.<para />
            Depreciated (Set to 2 in newer fonts).<para />
            A neutral character has no inherent directionality; it is not a character with zero (0) width. Spaces and punctuation are examples of neutral characters.<para /> 
            Non-neutral characters are those with inherent directionality. For example, Roman letters (left-to-right) and Arabic letters (right-to-left) have directionality. 
            In a "normal" Roman font where spaces and punctuation are present, the font direction hints should be set to two (2).
