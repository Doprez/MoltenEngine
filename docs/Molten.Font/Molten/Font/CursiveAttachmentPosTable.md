            Some cursive fonts are designed so that adjacent glyphs join when rendered with their default positioning. 
            However, if positioning adjustments are needed to join the glyphs, 
            a cursive attachment positioning (CursivePos) subtable can describe how to connect the glyphs by aligning two anchor points: 
            the designated exit point of a glyph, and the designated entry point of the following glyph.<para />
