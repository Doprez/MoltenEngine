            GSUB - Reverse chaining contextual single substitution table. <para />
            This table describes single-glyph substitutions in context with an ability to look back and/or look ahead in the sequence of glyphs. 
            The major difference between this and other lookup types is that processing of input glyph sequence goes from end to start.<para />
