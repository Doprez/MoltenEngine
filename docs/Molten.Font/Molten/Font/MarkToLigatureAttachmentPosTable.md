            GPOS - Mark-to-Ligature Attachment Positioning Subtable.<para />
            The MarkToLigature attachment (MarkLigPos) subtable is used to position combining mark glyphs with respect to ligature base glyphs. 
            With MarkToBase attachment, described previously, each base glyph has an attachment point defined for each class of marks. 
            MarkToLigature attachment is similar, except that each ligature glyph is defined to have multiple components (in a virtual sense — not actual glyphs), 
            and each component has a separate set of attachment points defined for the different mark classes.<para />
