<tr>
   <td>AddressU</td>
<td>Gets or sets the method to use for resolving a U texture coordinate that is outside the 0 to 1 range.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
   <td>AddressV</td>
<td>Gets or sets the method to use for resolving a V texture coordinate that is outside the 0 to 1 range.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
   <td>AddressW</td>
<td>Gets or sets the method to use for resolving a W texture coordinate that is outside the 0 to 1 range.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
   <td>BorderColor</td>
<td>Border color to use if SharpDX.Direct3D11.TextureAddressMode.Border is specified 
            for AddressU, AddressV, or AddressW. Range must be between 0.0 and 1.0 inclusive.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
   <td>ComparisonFunc</td>
<td>A function that compares sampled data against existing sampled data. 
            The function options are listed in SharpDX.Direct3D11.Comparison.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
   <td>FilterMode</td>
<td>Gets or sets the filtering method to use when sampling a texture (see SharpDX.Direct3D11.Filter).</td>
</tr>
<tr>
   <td>MaxAnisotropy</td>
<td>Clamping value used if SharpDX.Direct3D11.Filter.Anisotropic or SharpDX.Direct3D11.Filter.ComparisonAnisotropic 
            is specified in SamplerFilter. Valid values are between 1 and 16.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
   <td>MaxMipMapLod</td>
<td>Upper end of the mipmap range to clamp access to, where 0 is the largest
                and most detailed mipmap level and any level higher than that is less detailed.
                This value must be greater than or equal to MinLOD. To have no upper limit
                on LOD set this to a large value such as D3D11_FLOAT32_MAX.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
   <td>MinMipMapLod</td>
<td>Lower end of the mipmap range to clamp access to, where 0 is the largest and most detailed mipmap level 
            and any level higher than that is less detailed.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
   <td>LodBias</td>
<td>Gets or sets the offset from the calculated mipmap level. For example, if Direct3D calculates 
            that a texture should be sampled at mipmap level 3 and MipLODBias is 2, then 
            the texture will be sampled at mipmap level 5.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
   <td>IsComparisonSampler</td>
<td>Gets whether or not the sampler a comparison sampler. This is determined by the <see cref="P:Molten.Graphics.IShaderSampler.FilterMode" /> mode.</td>
</tr>
